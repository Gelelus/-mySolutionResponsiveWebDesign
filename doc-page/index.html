   <header>What is JavaScript?</header>  
     <p>JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.</p>
     <p>The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.</p>
     <p>Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.</p>
     <p>In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.</p>
     <p >Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.</p>
     <p>The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.</p>
     <p>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>V8 – in Chrome and Opera.</li>
        <li> SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
        <li> …There are other codenames like “Trident” and “Chakra” for different versions of IE, “ChakraCore” for Microsoft Edge, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome and Opera.</p>

<div class = 'line'></div>
  
   
   
   <section class ='main-section' id ="statements">
     <header>Statements</header>  
     <p>Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.</p>
     <p>You've probably already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.</p>
     <p>We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.</p>
     <p>For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>alert('Hello'); alert('World');</code></p>
     <p>Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>alert('Hello');<br />alert('World');</code></p>
     
   </section>
   <section class ='main-section' id ="semicolons">
   <header>Semicolons</header>  
     <p>A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.</p>
     <p>This would also work:</p>
     <p class='code'><code> alert('Hello')<br /> alert('World')</code></p>
     <p>Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.
</p>
     <p>In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”!</p>
     <p>There are cases when a newline does not mean a semicolon. For example:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>alert(3 +<br />1<br />+ 2);</code></p>
     <p>The code outputs 6 because JavaScript does not insert semicolons here. It is intuitively obvious that if the line ends with a plus "+", then it is an “incomplete expression”, so the semicolon is not required. And in this case that works as intended.</p>
     <p>But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.</p>
     <p>Errors which occur in such cases are quite hard to find and fix.</p>
     <p>We recommend putting semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines. This rule is widely adopted by the community. Let’s note once again – it is possible to leave out semicolons most of the time. But it’s safer – especially for a beginner – to use them.</p>
   </section>
   
   <div class = 'line'></div>
<section class ='main-section' id ="comments">
     <header>Comments</header>  
     <p>As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and why.</p>
     <p>Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don’t affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.</p>
     <p>One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.</p>
     <p>The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement.</p>
     <p>Like here:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>// This comment occupies a line of its own<br />
      alert('Hello');</code></p>
     <p class='code'><code>alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement</code></p>
     <p>Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */.</p>
     <p>Like this:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>/* An example with two messages.<br />
       This is a multiline comment.<br />
         */<br />
alert('Hello');<br />
alert('World');</code></p>
     <p>The content of comments is ignored, so if we put code inside /* … */, it won’t execute.</p>
     <p>Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>/* Commenting out the code<br />
alert('Hello');><br />
*/<br />
alert('World');</code></p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to comment your code.</p>

<p>Comments increase the overall code footprint, but that’s not a problem at all. There are many tools which minify code before publishing to a production server. They remove comments, so they don’t appear in the working scripts. Therefore, comments do not have negative effects on production at all.</p>

   <div class = 'line'></div>
    <section class ='main-section' id = 'variables'>
     <header>Variables</header>  
     <p>Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:</p>
     <ol>
        <li>An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.</li>
        <li> A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Variables are used to store this information.</p>
     <p>A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.</p>
     <p>To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.</p>
     <p >The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:</p>
     <p>Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let message;</code></p>
     <p>Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let message;<br />
message = 'Hello'; // store the string</code></p>
     <p>The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let message;<br />
message = 'Hello!';<br />

alert(message); // shows the variable content</code></p>
     <p>To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value<br />
alert(message); // Hello!</code></p>
     <p>We can also declare multiple variables in one line:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let message;</code></p>
     <p class='code'><code>let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';</code></p>
     <p>That might seem shorter, but we don’t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a    single line per variable.</p>
     <p>The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let user = 'John';<br />
let age = 25;<br />
let message = 'Hello';
</code></p>
    <p>Some people also define multiple variables in this multiline style:</p>
    <p class='code'><code>let user = 'John',
  age = 25,<br />
  message = 'Hello';<br />
</code></p>
<p>…Or even in the “comma-first” style:</p>
<p  class='code'><code>let user = 'John'<br />
  , age = 25<br />
  , message = 'Hello';;</code></p>
<p>Technically, all these variants do the same thing. So, it’s a matter of personal taste and aesthetics.</p>
   </section>
 <div class = 'line'></div>
   <section class ='main-section' id ="variable_naming">
     <header>Variable naming</header>  
     <p>There are two limitations on variable names in JavaScript:</p>
     <ol>
        <li>The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _.</li>
        <li>The first character must not be a digit.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Examples of valid names:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let userName;<br />let test123;</code></p></p>
     <p>When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: myVeryLongName.</p>
     <p>What’s interesting – the dollar sign '$' and the underscore '_' can also be used in names. They are regular symbols, just like letters, without any special meaning.
     </p>
     <p>These names are valid:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let $ = 1; // declared a variable with the name "$"<br />
let _ = 2; // and now a variable with the name "_"</code></p>
     <p class='code'><code>alert($ + _); // 3</code></p>
     <p>Examples of incorrect variable names:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let 1a; // cannot start with a digit<br />
   let my-name; // hyphens '-' aren't allowed in the name</code></p>
     <p>It is possible to use any language, including cyrillic letters or even hieroglyphs, like this:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let имя = '...';<br />
let 我 = '...';</code></p>
     <p>Technically, there is no error here, such names are allowed, but there is an international tradition to use English in variable names. Even if we’re writing a small script, it may have a long life ahead. People from other countries may need to read it some time.</p>
     <p>There is a list of reserved words, which cannot be used as variable names because they are used by the language itself.</p>
     <p>For example: let, class, return, and function are reserved.</p>
     <p>The code below gives a syntax error:</p>
     <p class='code'><code>let let = 5; // can't name a variable "let", error!<br />
let return = 5; // also can't name it "return", error!</code></p>
